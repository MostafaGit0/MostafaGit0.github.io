            My journey with Apple led me to an internship where I was flown out to Cupertino to work alongside some of the brightest and most capable minds I’ve ever met. I was honored to join them.The trust they had in me that i would get any task that was asked of me done was the spark in my heart the brightened my day every time. 
            <br></br>
            My day-to-day involved attending morning stand-up meetings where each team member would share their goals for the day, automating workflows for our bug triage engineers, and stepping in to triage bugs myself when the queue got busy.
            <br></br>
            On my first day, the manager told me, “This internship is a test run to prove to my managers that we need an automation specialist. So occasionally, I’ll throw random ideas at you — and I want you to build them.” I was shocked... and honestly, it made me feel special. It made me feel like my interview had already proven I was capable of changing minds.
            <br></br>
            And I did exactly that. I built tools that went above and beyond expectations. One of my scripts tracked our QA team’s commitment to prioritizing their own bugs — and it sparked an entire team meeting when the data revealed a major oversight. Another script automatically triaged a specific category of bugs that made up 40% of the queue. Many of my projects followed that same theme of pattern recognition and optimization.
            <br></br>
            I even got the chance to present one of these tools to senior managers — the same ones who were skeptical about needing an automation specialist.
            <br></br>
            This internship was truly the highlight of my experience so far and i'm grateful for it everyday
